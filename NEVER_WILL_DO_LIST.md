#NEVER WILL DO LIST
* Insta-gib / Single weapon modes (make a mod if you really want such a thing)
* Round based game types
* Clan Arena game type
* Over 50 gametypes
* Loadouts
* Global ammo
* Have absolute weapon balance
* Make MFA into a Quake 3/OpenArena mod
* Make MFA just like OpenArena (please go back to OA please if you want OA)
* Remove blood and guts
* Cater to E-Sport organizations (in regards to censorship)
* Have more than one player model
* Bring back the railgun
* Have notifications pop up when a friend joins some random server
* Choice to ban a player via a callvote
* Add Bloodrun to vanilla MFA (unless the original author donates the map to MFA, and fix the damn spawn points)
* Add Aerowalk to vanilla MFA... Aerowalk is the worst map design ever, which caters to 12 year old hyperactive wanna-be "gangsta" kids
* Have game only launch inside a web browser (we've seen that QuakeLive failed at such)
* Odd or foreign characters in name
* Phsyics from CMPA (not many supported MegaFrag (a Q3 mod) that was working to have such physics), also Reflex has such physics, so play that instead FFS
* Make textures less dirty, and more like simplistic cartoon graphics (Warsow)
* Flat texture mode
