#TODO:
- "specMode", where a spectator can follow the player who fragged last (lastFrag), or is in the lead (leader).  (This is already somewhat available, but still incomplete)
- Add jet pack
- Add power shield
- Have ui function to allow switched mouse buttons (LMB/RMB)
- Remove anything that will cause the compiler to assume the name of the game is Quake3 or IOQuake3.
- Make the game as satanic as possible.
