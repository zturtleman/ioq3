Update 16XXXX
-------------
- Source code now on Github.
- Players are now given credit for crushing another player with a crusher.
- Map "MFDM10: Deadly heights" is added.
- Depending on the gametype, matches are now split up into two rounds.  If the first round ends, the player who's behind must have at least half the score of the leader to advance to the next round.  There are no breaks in between rounds, and second rounds starts with no interuption, as if there were no rounds.  It should be noted and cleared out, that this is no way related to Clan Arena, and Clan Arena will NEVER be a part of MFArena, due to Clan Arena having such a toxic community.
- Handicap is no longer simular to Quake 3's handicap in anyway what so ever.  A player with a handicap of 100, will receive 100% of extra damage dealt, while setting handicap to 0, will disable the handicap.  Players updating using an older game config may want to change their handicap, since it may be archived as 100.  Also, handicap should no longer be archived (saved in the configs).
- Super Shotgun has been slightly tweaked.  Reload for the Super Shotgun was increased by 200 ms.  However, there was a slight buff as well.  One pellet will at least hit where the crosshair is pointing.


Update 151108
-------------
- Fixed mislabeled location in "MFDM04".  Hallway with the flamethrower is now the "Flamethrower hallway", not shotgun.
- Outdated servers will no longer show in the browser window.  This will however change after the game goes into alpha or beta.


Update 151030
-------------
- Added bobbing effect and old film effect during intermission.
- Blaster now has a charge shot when the gun isn't fired within a couple seconds.  Damage will range from 10 to 25, where 25 is a fully charged shot, and 10 is the normal shot.
- Using the lightnign gun with quad damage now correctly adjust variable damage.
- Lava and slime damage has been changed to be more or less damaging.  The damage output is now applied every 100 msecs. instead of 700 msecs., but the damage values have been lowered per output.  Lava will killer quicker now if player has no armor, while slime will not kill as quickly to the point where only the armor decays (assuming the player has good armor).
- Command variable "g_shortGame" is added, which shorted the timelimit of the match by half (custom or rule-set enabled).  This does not effect overtime, or the score limit.  And yes, if the match is normally 5 minutes, it would be 2 minutes and 30 seconds with "g_shortGame" set.
- Place-holder models for the weapons have been made.  They look like crap from pre-alpha Reflex, but this is progress towards getting alpha status.
- Models for all the items have been made.
- Cheat protected cvar "cg_simpleitems".  All models are at least nearly complete, or have place holder models that represent their respected function.
- Modified damage knockback slide time.
- The super-shotgun's knockback has been modified.  Knockback isn't as massive, but the ground knockback time has been increased and modified.  Quad-super-shotgun will still knock people into space.
- Players can now be knocked off ladders when damaged.
- Added commands "follownextpowerup". "followprevpowerup", "follownextobj" and "followprevobj" for spectators, which will follow players that are holding a power up or an objective item such as a flag.
- Added map "MFDM08: Deadly Slimey Place".
- Added more health bit and armor shard items to "MFDM05".
- Fixed misplaced clip boxes in "MFDM05" by the chaingun and ammo crate stacks.
- Increased keycard respawn to 30 seconds in a rule-set enabled game that does not have keycard-stay enabled.
- End-game stats are now working again, and should not crash the server.  Open console to see stats at the end of a match.
- Fixed spawns in "MFDM07" when the map starts with more than 8 players.  Silly incorrect case ("info_player_deathmatch_Alt" should be "info_player_deathmatch_alt").  :P
- Lava in "MFARENA02" is no longer deep, allowing the player to jump out of it easier.
- HUD element showing the players key presses, can now be scaled and moved around via cvars.  Items "hud_keys_align", "hud_keys_xPos", "hud_keys_xAlign", "hud_keys_yPos", "hud_keys_scale" are added.  Also, the default key press color has changed from light blue to light gray (avoiding some possible confusion with team colors).


Update 150731
-------------
- Changed master servers, since IOQuake3's master server does not seem to work at all with MFArena.  MFArena will now use DPMaster as the new master server, and the game's protocol version is now set to 72, so MFArena servers will not show up in OpenArena.  Also, while demos will no longer show up in MFArena due to the protocol version change, they won't work in the updated version anyway, even reverting to the older protocol version.
- Command variables "hud_weaponBar_angle" and "hud_ammoBar_angle" now somewhat function.  Setting a value of "2" will reverse the order of the items listed.  Note, that setting to an odd value (eg. "1") will not display anything at all, as both HUD elements are not fully functional yet.
- Ammo on the HUD ammo bar will flash "MAX" when carried ammo is at its max.
- Vote options "g_proMode", "g_matchMode", "g_ruleSet", "g_teamSize" and "ext" were added.  Vote option "ext" along with an argument allows for custom voting options.  For example, calling "/callvote ext ffa", will execute "vstr ext_ffa" in the server if set by the server administrator.
- Calling a vote for a different gametype will now restart the map to that gametype, instead of waiting for the match to end.
- Re-added compiling script "cross-make-mingw64.sh" from an older version of IOQuake3/MFArena.  If you want to cross compile MFArena to 64-bit Windows via 64-bit Linux, you can use this script.  The same applies for 32-bit Windows via "cross-make-mingw32.sh".
- Some item respawn time changes had been made, mainly regarding the ammo.  Ammo will now respawn in 30 seconds when in weapon-stay mode, and 15 seconds elsewise.
- Base "PK3" files are now numbered in single didgets.
- Fixed up some spawns in "MFBASES02" again.  Mainly this time, Quad Damage is suppose to spawn in all game types, this is now fixed.  Also, player spawns in CTF are correctly using the "team_base_*" spawn item, not the "team_CTF_*" spawn item which is set to be removed in future updates.  Note, the power shield does not exist yet, so you'll still see a couple errors on it not spawning.
- The included HUD config "hud-std.cfg" was fixed, and no longer screws up the alignment of the HUD.
- Included HUD config "hud-big.cfg" was renamed to "hud-huge.cfg", while a new "hud-big.cfg" was made which is a medium sized HUD compared to "hud-huge.cfg".


Update 150717
-------------
- Demos should now play without overflowing the command buffer with ruleset requests.  Ruleset requests from the client is now pulled from server info.
- Added cvar "g_matchMode", where setting to a range from 0 to 4 will change the way weapons are used.  0 = pick up each weapon once (default), 1 = always pick up weapons, 2 = no ammo pickups, always pick up weapons (simular to Reflex), 3 = start with most weapons (san GL, SS and TF), infinite ammo, 250 max health and tier 3 armor, 4 = start with all weapons, and limited ammo, 200 health and tier 3 armor.
- Players now leave backpacks instead of weapons when fragged.  Each backpack contains the player's ammo, and current weapon.
- Blaster damage has been reduced from 25 pts to 10.
- When player runs out of ammo, the next weapon on the list will be selected, instead of switching to the last weapon on the list.  Also, the Blaster won't be selected until no other weapon can be used.
- Player's health is no longer capped at 200 points (unless in weapon mode 2, where it's 250), instead capped at 666 points.
- Mega health will no longer respawn until the player who took it comes back to 100 health and after the decay period has started.  Also, any other megas that are taken afterwards, will result in the health decay rate to increase by 100% per pickup.  The decay rate will revert back to 1 point per seconds, after the player returns to the normal max health of 100.  Health bits (5 health) do not count as part of the mega, even though they allow for the player to go over the normal max health.
- Added power-up "Pentagram Of Protection", which makes the player nearly invulnerable for normally 30 seconds.  After a player grabs it, another will respawn in 5 minutes from right after being grabbed.  Players cannot telefrag a player (via teleporter) that's possesses the "Pentagram Of Protection" power-up.  Attempting to do so, will result in the attacker getting telefragged instead.  Should note, that the armor is not protected while possesses the "Pentagram Of Protection" power-up, and will decay via damage.
- Added maps "MFDM06: Deadly Fortress" and "MFBASES01: Deadly Crossroads".
- The splash damage radius from rockets and grenades are no longer extended when player has Quad Damage.
- Matches can now end in a stalemate when no frags have been made, this should end boring matches.
- Server command variable "sv_floodProtect" is now less strict.  Commands will now be ignored when 4 commands are ran within under a second from one another.
- A player can now respawn pressing jump, besides pressing fire and use_item.
- Players moving slow (walking) down steps will no longer make stepping sounds.  Before, they would make more noise than running normally.
- The default chat and team chat colors can be set per client, via cvars "chatColorCode" and "teamchatColorCode".
- Player now screams when in lava, just like in real life.
- Phantom bodies from player entities that were just gibbed, no longer make disembodied "falling" sounds when landing.
- Typing the "admin" command without a follow-up command will now show a list of commands.
- There is a buff with the lightning gun, but the maximum damage will take effect gradually with every consecutive hit.  The damage will start at 8, and will increase up to 12 afterwards, as long as the target is hit.
- Match ending messages are now in yellow text.
- Powerups are no longer hardcoded to not spawn in the tournament gametype, and can be enabled in a custom ruleset.
- Updated "MFDM04".  Fixed a alternative/team spawn point that was partially inside a crate, added "Pentagram of Protection" power up inside the plasma gun room, and modified some ammo to spawn in "free for all" as it does in team matches.
- Fixed HUD's show keys function not showing current key press of client while swimming.
- Hit sounds are no longer enabled for any of the standard rulesets, but can be enabled for custom rulesets.  Also, Hit sounds are enabled during warmup.
- Armor protections has change, and is now based on Quake 1's armor protection.  Jacket armor (green) has 30% protection, Combat armor (yellow) has 60% protection (unchanged) and Body armor has 80% protection.  Should note, that armor protection use to be based on Quake 3's CMPA mod.
- There is now an in-game announcer.
- Announcer will say things when you frag many players within 3 seconds from one another.
- Code is now up to date with IOQuake3.
- SDL2 and OPENGL2 now supported.  However, as a side effect, SDL mouse sensitivity has changed (most likely will move faster than you're use to).  Will look into fixing this.
- Linux user game data is now located in "~/.config/mfarena".  I'm doing my part to keep the user's home directory clean, other devs should really do the same.  ;)
- Added cvar "cg_switchToEmpty", which allows you to switch to an empty weapon.  Setting to '0' will prevent you from selecting a weapon with no ammo.
- Added cvar "g_armor".  Setting to 1 enables armor pickups, 0 removes armor from maps.
- Added cvar "cg_damagePlum", which shows your damage output in warmup.  Note, that this only shows in warmup, this ain't no sissy QuakeLive.
- Updated "MFDM05".  Crates that carry the yellow armor have been resized to make it easier to get up on them.  Rocket launcher and Chaingun were swapped, and some ammo were either moved around or added.  25 Health was added in the water by the shell ammo.
- Renamed cvar "cg_outOfAmmoChange" to "cg_switchOnEmpty" (to make it easier to remember).  The boolean values have been swapped, so setting it to '1' now enables auto switching on empty.
- Color theme for health and armor now share the same color scheme.  High tier armor (red) and health (mega) are now both red, while low tier armor (shard) and health (bit) are blue.  Also, simple icons for health items now reflect their model design counterpart.
- Map "MFDM02" has been updated, with some slight layout changes.  Mainly the secret room now has a dropdown floor where the Red Armor is.  Any other changes are purely cosmetic.
- Map "MFMASS01" now has some floating platforms by the mega health, with a "Pentagram Of Protection" power-up spawn suspended in air.
- Ammo items "ammo_multirockets" and "ammo_multirockets_small" (A.K.A. multi-rockets) have been removed.  Rocket ammo were going to be called multi-rockets, but there would be some confusion with the multi-rockets (from the Quake 1 mission pack) which upgrades rockets to shoot multiable rockets.  All older MFArena maps have been updated to use "ammo_rockets" and "ammo_rockets_small" instead.
- Added a "giveup" command for players that are losing in duels, which will end the match early.  Currently, this command works only in the tournament gametype.
- Fixed small scoreboard's overlapping issue with score numbers, anything 1000 and up is now scaled to fix.
- Scoring in Capture The Flag is now more based on the "Threewave" scoring system, but not completly.  Frags are added to the team score, along with bonuses.  Captures are now 25 points, plus the number of opponents multiplied by 25.  On a 4on4 match, a capture will give a team 125 points.
- Command variable "mercylimit" has been added, to end massively unbalanced match-ups quickly.  Note, that the game will use the hardcoded value based on the rule set, if it's not set to custom.
- Added map "MFDM07: Deadly Naughty Trap".
- There's no longer a reason for map makers to specify the gametype for CTF flags.  They will now only appear when the gametype is on CTF.  Quake 3 should had done this in the first place.
- The Spreadshot weapon has been removed.  Remove that frown though, because it will return in the future as an upgrade weapon for the plasma gun.  :)
- Teammate locations in the mini-map has been fixed.  Resizing the mini-map will no longer cause teammate locations on the mini-map to be scaled incorrectly.

* I acknowledge that QuakeLive now has "keys" (that unlocked gates/doors) which are pretty much Doom keycards (or Quake 1 keys even).  MFArena had this feature before QuakeLive, so please try to acknowledge that this is NOT a QuakeLive inspired feature, but inspired by Doom.  Thank you.


Update 140607
-------------
- Added a random select command, which you can enter some arguments, and it'll select one of them as a result.  This can be accessed via command "rnd".
- There is now an administrator mode for clients.  A player can either have a vote for them to be an admin, become one via password ("g_adminPassword"), or via server command from the server owner.
- An option for totally random spawns has been added.  It is unlike the current Quake 3 system, where you spawn/respawn on one of half of the farthest spawns from were you were fragged.  It is enabled for the 'hardcore' and 'nightmare' rulesets.
- Server command random pickup (or "rpickup" as the command is called) was added for warmup, which will randomly and evenly place players on teams.  This method used is better than what's used in OpenArena, since it's completly random.  This option can also be voted upon, and available as an admin command function.
- The voting message during votes now flashes when a new vote is called, and when someone casts a vote.
- Lightning discharge now extends out of the water, just like in Quake 1.
- Fixed an issue with the lightning discharge, where the player discharging the lightning gun, would survive.  The player now correctly dies, as intended.
- Removed the leftover debug message "DEBUG: S.SHOTGUN".
- Added map "MFDM05: Deadly Dock".
- Hopefully fixed a rare issue, where a player could score a frag right after the match has ended.
- A random number select command ("rndnum") was added, which will randomly choose a number depending on the range entered.
- The "NULL poly shader" error message, that floods the console when swimming in lava or water, has been fixed.
- Commands "vote yes", "vote no" and "ready" can now be set in the controls set-up menu.
- Fixed bug in team scoreboard, where if the red team had 10 or more players, blue players won't show on the scoreboard.  Also, if the blue team had more than 10 players, the next players would overflow off the scoreboard.
- Added an automatic map rotation function, which will read a "cfg" file (from what ever "g_mapRotation" is set to) to pull up maps, and randomly select that map for the next match.  There is no longer any need use the old Quake 3 method of creating a map rotation.
- Changed the calculation of splash damage radius, to be more closer to the calculation of Quake 1.  For example; if you are in range of the splash damage radius, you will get at least a mandatory 1/3 of the splash damage.  Due to the change, the range of the rocket and grenade splash radius had been reduced, back to the size as it was in Quake 3.  Note, that quad-damage still extends the splash radius.
- Some maps had their spawn points modified, to make use of the new alternate (player-overflow) spawn point.


Update 140405
-------------
- Super shotgun now uses the correct MOD.
- Due to the fix above, it now has more push back as intended.  Where before, it wasn't powerful at all.
- Player's (clan) tag is now displayed on the tournament gametype scoreboard.
- Moved method of counting clients to game's QVM.  Connected client counts should no longer be prone to spoofed counts, unless server runs a server side mod to do such.  :/
- Break points for grabbing lower tier armor has been adjusted to be mathematically correct.  Basically, the math is as follows: ( [WANTED_LOWER_TIER]protectionRate / [CUR_TIER]protectionRate ) * [WANTED_LOWER_TIER]maxArmorPoints
- Maps can now specify the timelimit for each gametype (unless a custom ruleset is enabled).
- Fixed in-game timer chat bug, where the in-game timer in chat would not be reset after a map restart.
- Added a function that mutes a player, who spams alot.  Cvars "g_spamLimitCount" and "g_spamLimitTimeRange" controls how it functions.
- Some models have been created, but many have yet to be made.  It's still recommended to keep "cg_simpleItems" set for the time being.  Also, the new models will look better in the future.
- Options to allow spectators to vote and call a vote are now available, via cvars "g_allowSpecVote" and "g_allowSpecCallVote".
- Value for the cvar "g_ruleset" is no longer latched 'til the next map, since a check is now done to see if the map has started in a warmup.  Before, there was an issue where the match would falsely start when the ruleset changed, in which depending on the ruleset could disable warmup.
- Increased the damage output of the lightning gun from 8 damage per hit to 10.  It also now uses 2 cells instead of 1.  Cell ammo now gives 50 cells instead of 30.
- Fixed screen overlay for power ups, where players not using an aspect ratio of 4:3, will see the overlay only cover part of the screen.
- The loading and awaiting game state screen has been redesigned.
- Chaingun bullet ammo has been increased from 25 to 50.
- Most of the game code have been updated to be up to date with the updates done in IOQuake3.  However, some altered items have been rejected, such as the "status" server command.
- Added command in warmup for a coinflip, via command "coinflip".
- Weapon list in the keys set-up now display the correct weapon.
- Added map "MFARENA02: Lava Whore".


Update 140224
-------------
- Fixed bug with "g_demeritLimit" in CTF, where the player with the flag reaching the demerit limit, would be removed along with the flag, breaking the match.  Also, "g_demeritLimit" no longer has any effect during warmup.
- Totally new weapon set, with shared ammo.  This removes the old Q3 weapon/ammo system, and combines weapons from Q1 and Q2.  Super shotgun is introduced, and the Spreadshot from MegaFrag(Q3A) makes its return.  That being said, some maps will have ammo moved around.
- Shotgun pelets are reduced to 6 pelets, but still at 10 damage per pelet.  The super shotgun shoots 12 pelets, with 6 inner pelets causing an extra 10 damage.  The super shotgun blast will (should) also cause massive knockback.
- Added cvar "cg_outOfAmmoChange", which by default automatically switches to the next weapon when you run out of ammo for your current weapon.  Setting to "0" will disable the auto switch.
- Moved some weapons around in "MFDM04", to compensate the new weapon set.  Chaingun makes its appearance in the yellow room, moving the shotgun to the new compartment in the mega room.  The lightning gun however gets cut from the map, or simply put, gets the "shaft".  :b
- Quad damage now increases the damage radius of rockets and grenades.  Player with the quad is now more scary, as in QuakeWorld.
- Emoticons can now be used in chat text (HUD only), this can also be disabled via cvar "hud_useEmoticons".
- Weapon bar and ammo bar can now be moved around, and customized via cvars "hud_weaponBar_*" and "hud_ammoBar_*" respectfully.
- Info text boxes (chat/teamchat/notifier) can now be moved around and scaled via cvar "hud_infoBox#_*".
- Frag messages can now be moved around and scaled via cvar "hud_fragInfo_*".
- Power up second amounts no longer can be stacked (eg: [timeLeft]+30s).  As a side effect, this also prevents the power up timer from overflowing, which causes the client to crash back to the main menu.
- A new icon was finally made for the Quad.
- The crosshair style can now be changed via "hud_crosshair_innerType" and "hud_crosshair_outsideType".
- Game information and rulesets (timelimit, scorelimit, etc.) are now restored when performing a "vid_restart" command and such.  Before, everything would be zeroed, and display incorrect information.
- When cvar "g_teamSize" is set to 0, and a rule set is enabled, the time limit will be based on the number of clients per team.
- Rule set is now displayed in the HUD during warmup.
- New textures were made to replace the placeholder ones.
- New ambient world sounds were added.
- Map function: Splash damage can now be disregarded on buttons and doors, via key function "ignoresplash".
- The screen now has an overlay glow depending on the power up you grab (quad).  This can be modified via cvar "cg_powerupOverlay".
- A player can now have a (clan) tag in front of their name, via cvar "tag", which will be shown in the scoreboard.
- some minor log display fixes.
- Added an item pickup overlay flash.  Can be enabled or disabled via cvar "cg_itemPickUpOverlay".
- Warm-up countdown now plays a tone, when counting down the last 10 seconds before the match begins.
- The countdown now starts at the correct number as to what the cvar "g_warmup" or the ruleset warm-up value is set to.
- Added a new ruleset called "Nightmare!" (ruleset 3), which is just like "Hardcore", but with quadmode set.  This also pushes "Arena" to ruleset 4.
- Map "MFDM18: Deadly Wide Loop" is now known as "MFMASS01: Deadly Wide Loop", which starts a new set of maps which are massive.
- Map "MFBASES1301: Deadly Camp Bases" is now known as "MFBASES02: Deadly Camp Bases".
- Map "MFARENA1301: Whore Practice" is now known as "MFARENA01: Whore Practice".
- All maps were updated for the new weapon set, and with some kind of modification to each map.
- Spectators in freefloat mode no longer sees the health, armor, weapon, ammo information in the HUD.
- Mini maps are alot cleaner, and much less cluttered.  Also, all maps have a mini map.


Update 131116
-------------
- The cvar "g_ruleSet" now has an effect on the friendly fire cvar.
- A player's killing streak is now displayed per 5 frags.  The player's highest killing streak is also displayed in the 'end of match' stats.
- Self damage can now be disabled.
- Map "MFDM03" now has a shotgun weapon.  Where before, only the ammo was available.
- End of match stats rule set information, was moved to the "RULE SET:" line.  The output is now less redundant.
- Added the flamethrower weapon.  Maps "MFDM02" and "MFBASES1301" are the only maps that uses the flamethrower.  Of course if you were wondering about some empty spots in a map, there's most likely an item there, that hasn't been coded in yet.
- Lightning gun now discharges in water.  Bring some friends over for an electrifying swim.
- Increased the item height bounds, since it was possible to jump over items, and miss them.
- Kick votes now require 3/4 of yes votes to pass, and there must be at least four active players to call such a vote.
- Added map "MFDM04" - Deadly Lava.
- Added new rule set "Arena", which enables quadmode, double ammo and removes self damage and friendly fire.
- Removed cvar "g_doWarmup", and cvar "g_warmup" is now only enabled when a valid value is used.
- The cvar "g_warmup" is a part of the ruleset, which only can be modified when running a custom ruleset.
- Removed vote option "g_doWarmup", and added vote option "endWarmup", which forces players to ready up.
- Plasma balls are now magenta.
- Some new textures and sound effects were created.
- Map "MFDM18" had a makeover.
- Map "MFDM02" had a minor layout change, to fix a mapping error.
- The tournament gametype now has its own scoreboard layout.
- Bots are no longer allowed on dedicated servers, sorry.
- Ruleset cvars will now disqualified a match when changed.  This does not apply to the cvar "g_doWarmup".
- Game UI now mostly use a proportional font, however is somewhat broken.  Deal with it, until I design a new UI.

* Also, enjoy the current weapon set while you can, some weapons will be replaced in the next major update.


Update 130817
-------------
- Bug with the "Timelimit hit" announcement along with the buzzer sound, at the 'beginning' of the match, is fixed.
- Added cvar "g_ruleset", which uses a hardcoded rule set per game mode, which if set will lock functions like time limit and such.  Currently, '0' - '2' are valid options.  '0' is for custom rule sets, '1' features the fun rule set standard (default), and '2' is considered the classic/hardcore mode.
- The issue from the IOQuake update, where the screen blacks out at the connection screen, is fixed.
- Weapon bar cursor now updates when watching a demo.  However, a side effect of this fix, causes the weapon bar cursor to not update, until the weapon is fully switched to.
- Player stats at the end of the match, now appears in the console.
- Fixed a flaw in CTF, where a player could score a capture at the end of a match, within the second before intermission.  This is actually an old bug from Quake 3: Arena.
- Spectators are now shown under the score board.
- A new map was added, "mfdm01: Deadly Simplicity".  It features four rooms, all connecting to each other one way or another.
- Maps "mfdm1301" and "mfdm1302" are now known as "mfdm02: Deadly Technology" and "mfdm03: Deadly Walk", respectfully in that order.
- Speaking of "mfdm02" and "mfdm03", they're beginning to look alot better, with some new textures and detail.
- Added a demerit system, which will suspend a player from the game.  A demerit is based on each suicide, and team kill.  When the demerit limit is reached, the player will be forced to spectate, and can no longer join the game.
- The physics/special button (+button12) can now be set in the misc. controls screen.
- The title screen has been updated.


Update 130601
-------------
- Overtime now works.
- Also, unlike Quakelive, the "overtime" cvar sets overtime by minutes, not seconds.
- A sound now plays when entering sudden death, or overtime.
- A buzzer sounds when the match ends (hitting timelimit/scorelimit).
- The plasma firing sound was made slightly easier on the ears, thanks to hooking the computer up to real speakers (not headphones).
- A verbose option is now available via cvar "g_verboseLog" for log files.
- Voting options can now be disabled via cvar "g_allowedVoteNames".
- Mute and Unmute server commands to mute Scassapalle is now available, which can be called by vote as well.
- The table "status" server command was altered a bit, moving the player's name at the end of the table, and renaming column "LastMsg" to "LastCom".
- The bookkeeping function ("g_bookkeepingLog") was added from MegaFrag, which logs the total amount of clients and active players per match.
- Deathmatch maps "mfdm1301" and "mfdm1302" now can be played in the CTF gamemode, though it's not recommended to play CTF on those maps.

- ...And some other fixes here and there that I don't recall.
